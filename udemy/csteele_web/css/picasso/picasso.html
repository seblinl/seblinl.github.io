    <h1>Pablo Picasso</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist
        and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. Regarded as one of the most influential artists
        of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed
        sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and
        explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and the anti-war
        painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces
        during the Spanish Civil War.</p>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Picasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga, Andalusia, in southern Spain. He was the
        first child of Don José Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López. Picasso's family was of
        middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other
        game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local
        museum. Ruiz's ancestors were minor aristocrats.</p>
    <p>Picasso's birth certificate and the record of his baptism include very long names, combining those of various
        saints and relatives. Ruiz y Picasso were his paternal and maternal surnames, respectively, per Spanish
        custom. The surname "Picasso" comes from Liguria, a coastal region of north-western Italy; its capital is
        Genoa. There was a painter from the area named Matteo Picasso (1794–1879), born in Recco (Genoa), of
        late neoclassical style portraiture, though investigations have not definitively determined his kinship with
        the branch of ancestors related to Pablo Picasso. The direct branch from Sori, Liguria (Genoa), can be traced
        back to Tommaso Picasso (1728–1813). His son Giovanni Battista, married to Isabella Musante, was Pablo's
        great-great-grandfather. Of this marriage was born Tommaso (Sori, 1787–Málaga, 1851). Pablo's maternal
        great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso moved to Spain around 1807.</p>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Before 1900</h3>
    <p>Picasso's training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection of early
        works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive records extant of
        any major artist's beginnings. During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894
        his career as a painter can be said to have begun. The academic realism apparent in the works of the
        mid-1890s is well displayed in The First Communion (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola. In
        the same year, at the age of 14, he painted Portrait of Aunt Pepa, a vigorous and dramatic portrait that
        Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called "without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish
        painting."</p>

    <h3>Blue Period: 1901–1904</h3>
    <p>Picasso's Blue Period (1901–1904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green
        only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of
        the year. Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso
        divided his time between Barcelona and Paris. In his austere use of colour and sometimes doleful subject
        matter—prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects—Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the
        suicide of his friend Carles Casagemas. Starting in autumn of 1901, he painted several posthumous portraits of
        Casagemas culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting La Vie (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.
