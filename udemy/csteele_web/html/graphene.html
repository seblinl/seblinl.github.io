        <h1>Graphene</h1>

        <img src="512px-Graphen.jpg" alt="Graphene structure, 3D rendering">

        <p>Graphene (/ˈɡræfiːn/[1]) is an <b>allotrope</b> of carbon consisting of a single layer of atoms arranged in a
            two-dimensional honeycomb lattice[2][3] nanostructure.[4] The name is derived from "graphite" and the suffix
            -ene, reflecting the fact that the graphite allotrope of carbon contains numerous double bonds.</p>

        <p>Scientists theorized the potential existence and production of graphene for decades. It has likely been
            unknowingly produced in small quantities for centuries, through the use of pencils and other similar
            applications of graphite. It was possibly observed in electron microscopes in 1962, but studied only while
            supported on metal surfaces.[12]</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Structure of graphite and its intercalation compounds</h3>
        <p>The theory of graphene was first explored by P. R. Wallace in 1947 as a starting point for understanding the
            electronic properties of 3D graphite. The emergent massless Dirac equation was first pointed out in 1984
            separately by Gordon Walter Semenoff,[29] and by David P. DiVincenzo and Eugene J. Mele.[30] Semenoff
            emphasized
            the occurrence in a magnetic field of an electronic Landau level precisely at the Dirac point. This level is
            responsible for the anomalous integer quantum Hall effect.[31][32][33]</p>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <h3>Bonding</h3>
        <p>Three of the four outer-shell electrons of each atom in a graphene sheet occupy three sp2 hybrid orbitals – a
            combination of orbitals s, px and py — that are shared with the three nearest atoms, forming σ-bonds. The
            length
            of these bonds is about 0.142 nanometers.[54][55]</p>

        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <h3>Electronic</h3>
        <p>Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, because its conduction and valence bands meet at the Dirac points. The
            Dirac points are six locations in momentum space, on the edge of the Brillouin zone, divided into two
            non-equivalent sets of three points. The two sets are labeled K and K'. The sets give graphene a valley
            degeneracy of gv = 2. By contrast, for traditional semiconductors the primary point of interest is generally
            Γ,
            where momentum is zero.[54] Four electronic properties separate it from other condensed matter systems.</p>
        <h4>Electronic spectrum</h4>
        <p>Electrons propagating through graphene's honeycomb lattice effectively lose their mass, producing
            quasi-particles
            that are described by a 2D analogue of the Dirac equation rather than the Schrödinger equation for spin-1/2
            particles.[64][65]</p>
